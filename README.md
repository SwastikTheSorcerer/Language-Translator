# 🌐 Caveman Language Translator

A beginner-friendly web app that lets you translate words and short phrases between languages using a free translation API. Built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript** — no frameworks, no backend.

This is my practice project to get my hands on web development.

## ⚠️ Limitations
